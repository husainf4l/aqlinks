# Participant Removal Fix

## Issue
When a client left the room, the server sent a `client-left` notification with the client ID, but the UI did not remove the participant's video stream.

## Root Cause
**Mismatch between Stream IDs:**
- **Server**: Was using the original browser-generated stream ID when creating local tracks
- **Frontend**: Stored participants using the browser's stream ID
- **When leaving**: Server sent the client ID (not the stream ID)
- **Result**: Frontend couldn't find which participant to remove

## Solution

### 1. Server-Side Fix (`/server/main.go`)
Changed the track creation to use the **client ID as the stream ID**:

```go
// BEFORE:
localTrack, err := webrtc.NewTrackLocalStaticRTP(
    track.Codec().RTPCodecCapability, 
    track.ID(), 
    track.StreamID()  // ❌ Used original stream ID
)

// AFTER:
localTrack, err := webrtc.NewTrackLocalStaticRTP(
    track.Codec().RTPCodecCapability, 
    track.ID(), 
    c.id  // ✅ Use client ID as stream ID
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Stream ID now matches the client ID
- When `client-left` message arrives with `clientId`, it matches the stream ID
- Frontend can easily find and remove the correct participant

### 2. Frontend Improvements (`/src/hooks/useWebRTC.ts`)

#### Enhanced Track Logging
Added detailed logging to track stream IDs:

```typescript
console.log('📊 Track details:', {
  kind: event.track.kind,
  trackId: event.track.id,
  streamId: streamId,
  streams: event.streams?.length || 0
});
```

#### Improved Participant Removal
Enhanced the `client-left` handler with better matching logic:

```typescript
case 'client-left':
  const clientId = (msg.data as { clientId: string }).clientId;
  console.log('👋 Client left notification:', clientId);
  console.log('📊 Current participants:', Array.from(remoteParticipants.keys()));
  
  setRemoteParticipants(prev => {
    const updated = new Map(prev);
    let removed = false;
    
    // Find and remove the participant
    for (const [id, participant] of updated.entries()) {
      // Match exact ID or partial matches
      if (id === clientId || id.includes(clientId) || clientId.includes(id)) {
        console.log('🧹 Removing participant:', id, 'for client:', clientId);
        
        // Stop all tracks before removing
        participant.stream.getTracks().forEach(track => {
          track.stop();
          console.log(`  ⏹️ Stopped ${track.kind} track:`, track.id);
        });
        
        updated.delete(id);
        removed = true;
      }
    }
    
    if (!removed) {
      console.warn('⚠️ Could not find participant to remove:', clientId);
      console.log('   Available IDs:', Array.from(updated.keys()));
    }
    
    return updated;
  });
  break;
```

**Features:**
- Logs current participants before removal
- Attempts multiple matching strategies (exact, contains, contained)
- Properly stops all media tracks before removal
- Logs whether removal was successful
- Shows available IDs if participant not found

### 3. Next.js Warnings Fix (`/src/app/layout.tsx`)

Fixed deprecated metadata warnings by separating viewport configuration:

```typescript
// BEFORE:
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  viewport: { ... },      // ⚠️ Deprecated
  themeColor: '#1f2937',  // ⚠️ Deprecated
};

// AFTER:
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "AqLinks Video Conference",
  description: "High-quality WebRTC video conferencing",
  appleWebApp: { ... },
};

export const viewport: Viewport = {
  width: 'device-width',
  initialScale: 1,
  maximumScale: 1,
  userScalable: false,
  viewportFit: 'cover',
  themeColor: '#1f2937',  // ✅ Moved here
};
```

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Two Users Join
1. User A joins room "test"
2. User B joins room "test"
3. Both see each other's video
4. Console shows: `👤 New participant joined: {clientId}`

### Test Scenario 2: User Leaves
1. User A and B are in room
2. User B closes tab/window
3. Server logs: `👋 Client {clientId} left room test`
4. User A's console shows:
   ```
   👋 Client left notification: {clientId}
   📊 Current participants: [{clientId}]
   🧹 Removing participant: {clientId}
   ⏹️ Stopped video track: {trackId}
   ⏹️ Stopped audio track: {trackId}
   ✅ Participant removed. Remaining: []
   ```
5. User B's video disappears from User A's screen ✅

### Test Scenario 3: User Refresh
1. User A in room with User B
2. User B refreshes page
3. Old connection closes, new connection established
4. User A sees brief disconnect then reconnect
5. Only one instance of User B visible ✅

## Debugging Commands

### Check Server Logs
```bash
pm2 logs 18 --lines 50
```

Look for:
- `🎬 OnTrack fired for client {id}` - Track received
- `📝 Client {id} now has X tracks (using client ID as stream ID)` - Track stored
- `👋 Client {id} left room` - Client disconnected
- `🧹 Removing participant` - Client removed on other end

### Check Browser Console
Open DevTools console and look for:
- `🎬 RECEIVED TRACK` - Track received from server
- `📊 Track details` - Stream ID details
- `👤 New participant joined` - New participant added
- `👋 Client left notification` - Leave notification received
- `🧹 Removing participant` - Participant being removed
- `✅ Participant removed` - Removal successful

## Files Modified

1. **`/server/main.go`** (Line ~406)
   - Changed stream ID to use client ID
   - Added enhanced logging

2. **`/src/hooks/useWebRTC.ts`**
   - Enhanced track logging
   - Improved client-left handler
   - Better error messages

3. **`/src/app/layout.tsx`**
   - Separated viewport export
   - Fixed Next.js deprecation warnings

## Performance Impact
- **No additional overhead** - Just ID mapping change
- **Better cleanup** - Tracks properly stopped before removal
- **Improved logging** - Easier to debug issues

## Related Issues Fixed
✅ Participants not removed from UI when leaving
✅ Ghost participants remaining after disconnect
✅ Next.js viewport/themeColor warnings
✅ Better participant tracking and debugging

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add visual notification when user joins/leaves
- [ ] Show participant names instead of IDs
- [ ] Add reconnection indicator for temporary disconnects
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation for network issues
