# Voice Agent Status Report

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Complete STT ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí TTS Pipeline
- ‚úÖ **Speech Detection (VAD)** - Detecting when user speaks
- ‚úÖ **Whisper STT** - Transcribing speech correctly
- ‚úÖ **OpenAI LLM (GPT-4)** - Generating intelligent responses
- ‚úÖ **OpenAI TTS** - Synthesizing speech responses
- ‚úÖ **WebRTC Audio** - Sending/receiving audio through SFU server

### Successful Transcriptions
```
User: "1-2-3 1-2-3"
Agent: [Responded via LLM]

User: "MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM"  
Agent: "Sounds like you might be thinking about something delicious! What's on your mind?"

User: "Oh"
Agent: "What's on your mind?"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues to Fix

### 1. Audio Echo in Frontend
**Problem:** Agent's voice is echoing back, causing noise/feedback
**Solution:** Need to implement echo cancellation or use `echoCancellation: true` in audio constraints

### 2. Audio Gain Settings
**Current:** 10x gain boost applied in agent
**Issue:** Might be too aggressive, causing clipping
**Recommendation:** 
- Try 3x-5x gain instead of 10x
- OR remove agent-side gain and rely on browser `autoGainControl`

### 3. VAD Sensitivity
**Current threshold:** 0.05 (energy-based)
**Issue:** Still flipping between speech/silence too frequently
**Recommendation:**
- Increase threshold to 0.08-0.10
- Add hysteresis (different thresholds for start/stop)
- Implement smoothing/debouncing

## üìä Current Configuration

```python
# Agent Config
class AgentConfig:
    sfu_url: "ws://localhost:8080/ws"
    room_name: "test"
    llm_model: "gpt-4"
    sample_rate: 48000
    channels: 1
    vad_threshold: 0.05 (hardcoded in _detect_speech)
    silence_duration: 1.5 seconds
```

## üîß Recommended Tuning

### Option 1: Reduce Gain Boost
```python
# In voice_agent.py, line ~420
# Change from:
audio_data = audio_data * 10.0
# To:
audio_data = audio_data * 3.0  # or 5.0
```

### Option 2: Improve VAD
```python
# Use hysteresis for more stable detection
speech_start_threshold = 0.08
speech_stop_threshold = 0.04  # Lower to avoid cutting off speech
```

### Option 3: Frontend Echo Cancellation
```typescript
// In useMediaDevices.ts
const audioConstraints = {
  echoCancellation: true,  // ‚úÖ Already enabled
  noiseSuppression: true,  // ‚úÖ Already enabled  
  autoGainControl: true,   // ‚úÖ Already enabled
  // But browser might need restart to take effect
}
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Reduce gain boost** from 10x to 3x-5x
2. **Increase VAD threshold** to 0.08-0.10 for more stability
3. **Add hysteresis** to VAD (different start/stop thresholds)
4. **Test echo cancellation** - ensure it's working in browser
5. **Optional:** Add visual feedback (show when agent is listening/speaking)

## üìù Files Modified

- `/home/husain/Desktop/aqlinks/aqlinks/agent/voice_agent.py` - Main agent logic
- `/home/husain/Desktop/aqlinks/aqlinks/src/hooks/useMediaDevices.ts` - Audio capture
- `/home/husain/Desktop/aqlinks/aqlinks/src/hooks/useWebRTC.ts` - WebRTC connection

## üöÄ The Agent WORKS!

The core functionality is complete and operational. The remaining issues are **tuning parameters** for better quality and user experience.
